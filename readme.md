A framework I am creating for fun and educational purposes, thus the reason I picked the license. (IMO play osu! on the real servers as it was intended.)

KaiBancho!Web (KaiBancho) is licensed under AGPL version 3 or later. Please see [the licence file](LICENCE) for more information. [tl;dr](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3-(agpl-3.0)) if you want to use any code, design or artwork from this project, attribute it and make your project open source under the same licence.

## Credit/Other things

- Osu! is a game developed by Dean "peppy" Herbert, and like all good things, he owns the title, and code.

- KaiBancho is based off of the work of Dillon "Itsyuka" Modine-Thuen and HoLLy-HaCKeR's packet method/code.

- If you like osu!, play on the real server and maybe drop some cash on there too, believe in the peppy, and the peppy will believe in you, unless you're Cookiezi.

- Howl for his Exp Calc (https://github.com/thehowl/OsuLevelCalculator)
